# Mammogram-Breast-Cancer-detection


**Overview**

Among many cancers, breast cancer is the second most common cause of death in women. Early detection and early treatment reduce breast cancer mortality. Mammography plays an important role in breast cancer screening because it can detect early breast masses or calcification regions.

**Signs of Breast Cancer:**
1. Weight loss
2. Skin changes
3. Pain
4. Breast changes
This project uses mammograms for breast cancer detection using deep learning techniques.

For the diagnosis of breast cancer doctors often use additional tests to find or diagnose breast cancer. A mammogram is an X-ray picture of the breast. Doctors use a mammogram to look for early signs of breast cancer. Regular mammograms are the best tests doctors have to find breast cancer early, sometimes up to three years before it can be felt. A mammogram shows how dense the breasts are. Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of getting breast cancer.
